# DebugAdapterProtocol

This is a Swift library for interacting with [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/). It contains type definitions and utilities useful for both server- and client-side projects.

It is, ahem, a work in progress.

## Contributing and Collaboration

I prefer collaboration, and would love to find ways to work together if you have a similar project.

I prefer indentation with tabs for improved accessibility. But, I'd rather you use the system you want and make a PR than hesitate because of whitespace.

## Suggestions and Feedback

I'd love to hear from you! Get in touch via [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@mattiem), an issue, or a pull request.
