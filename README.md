# DebugAdapterProtocol

This is a Swift library for interacting with [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/). It contains type definitions and utilities useful for both server- and client-side projects.

It is, ahem, a work in progress.

## Contributing and Collaboration

I prefer collaboration, and would love to find ways to work together if you have a similar project.

I prefer indentation with tabs for improved accessibility. But, I'd rather you use the system you want and make a PR than hesitate because of whitespace.

## Suggestions or Feedback

I would love to hear from you! Issues or pull requests work great. A [Matrix space][matrix] is also available for live help, but I have a strong bias towards answering in the form of documentation.
